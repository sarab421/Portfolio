    <p>
      Are you looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who combines technical
      expertise with a passion for web development? Someone who doesnâ€™t just
      build ML models but integrates them into fully functional, user-friendly
      projects?
    </p>
    <p>
      From the very beginning of my university journey, I wanted to gain
      industry experience early on. While many peers waited until graduation
      to start looking for internships, I took a different approach and
      started seeking internships during my 4th and 5th semesters, ensuring
      that by graduation, I already had relevant industry experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first internship was as a MERN Stack Developer at
      <u><b>Elite Apex Solutions</b></u>, where I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end
      development. I worked with ReactJS, Node.js, and with both the MongoDB
      and Firebase. After this, I worked part-time as a Web Development
      Instructor at <u><b>Peace Computer College</b></u>, refining my skills further (trust me, teaching is the best way
      to
      learn ðŸ˜‰â€”you never know whoâ€™s going to ask you what and when, so you
      better come fully prepared ðŸ˜‚).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the breakthrough momentâ€”AI took the world by storm, and
      technologies like ChatGPT sparked my curiosity. I realized that Machine
      Learning was the field I wanted to pursue. That same semester, my
      university introduced Machine Learning as a subject, and I dove into it
      headfirst. I excelled in the course, and my professor, recognizing my
      dedication, offered me a Teaching Assistant (TA) position. While working
      as a TA, I continued learning and deepened my expertise in Deep
      Learning, a field that fascinated me. This combination of teaching and
      hands-on learning solidified my decision to pursue a career in Machine
      Learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduating, I secured an internship as a Machine Learning Engineer
      at <u><b>Smart Zone Leaders</b></u>, where I worked on real-world ML projects. In just 1.5 months, my hard
      work was recognized, and I was offered a full-time position as an ML
      Engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      What sets me apart? My ability to bridge the worlds of Machine Learning
      and Web Development. Many ML engineers focus solely on models, but I
      bring a full-stack approach. I can take machine learning models and
      integrate them into complete, functional applications. Iâ€™m comfortable
      working with databases like MongoDB and Firebase, and my web development
      experience ensures I can build intuitive, user-friendly interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      With my unique skill set, I can help take your ML projects from concept
      to fully developed solutions that users will love. Letâ€™s connect if
      youâ€™re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can seamlessly
      integrate AI into practical applications.
