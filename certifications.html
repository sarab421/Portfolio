      <p>
        Are you looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who combines technical
        expertise with a passion for web development? Someone who doesnâ€™t just
        build ML models but integrates them into fully functional, user-friendly
        projects?
      </p>
      <p>
        From the very beginning of my university journey, I wanted to gain
        industry experience early on. While many peers waited until graduation
        to start looking for internships, I took a different approach and
        started seeking internships during my 4th and 5th semesters, ensuring
        that by graduation, I already had relevant industry experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first internship was as a MERN Stack Developer at
        <u><b>Elite Apex Solutions</b></u
        >, where I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end
        development. I worked with ReactJS, Node.js, and with both the MongoDB
        and Firebase. After this, I worked part-time as a Web Development
        Instructor at <u><b>Peace Computer College</b></u
        >, refining my skills further (trust me, teaching is the best way to
        learn ðŸ˜‰â€”you never know whoâ€™s going to ask you what and when, so you
        better come fully prepared ðŸ˜‚).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came the breakthrough momentâ€”AI took the world by storm, and
        technologies like ChatGPT sparked my curiosity. I realized that Machine
        Learning was the field I wanted to pursue. That same semester, my
        university introduced Machine Learning as a subject, and I dove into it
        headfirst. I excelled in the course, and my professor, recognizing my
        dedication, offered me a Teaching Assistant (TA) position. While working
        as a TA, I continued learning and deepened my expertise in Deep
        Learning, a field that fascinated me. This combination of teaching and
        hands-on learning solidified my decision to pursue a career in Machine
        Learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating, I secured an internship as a Machine Learning Engineer
        at <u><b>Smart Zone Leaders</b></u
        >, where I worked on real-world ML projects. In just 1.5 months, my hard
        work was recognized, and I was offered a full-time position as an ML
        Engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets me apart? My ability to bridge the worlds of Machine Learning
        and Web Development. Many ML engineers focus solely on models, but I
        bring a full-stack approach. I can take machine learning models and
        integrate them into complete, functional applications. Iâ€™m comfortable
        working with databases like MongoDB and Firebase, and my web development
        experience ensures I can build intuitive, user-friendly interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        With my unique skill set, I can help take your ML projects from concept
        to fully developed solutions that users will love. Letâ€™s connect if
        youâ€™re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can seamlessly
        integrate AI into practical applications.
